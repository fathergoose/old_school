                <h1>websites are hard</h1>
                <p>I wanted to make a blog about changing my career from chemist to web developer. This gave me a great idea: I will make the blog from scratch and gradually add in features as my skills improve.<p>
                <p>Sounds like a good idea right?</p>
                <p>But I didn't want my blog to look like some junk crap out of the 90s, and I have no ambitions of becoming any kind of designer (more of a back-end sort of guy). So I grabbed a UI-Framework. Specifically <a href="www.getmd.io">Material Design Lite</a>. I got the framework rocking with a nav-bar and standard layout then ran into an issue.</p>
                <h3>This would need to be repeated on every page</h3>
                <p>Awe crap. Well, I took care of that and great. I have an about me, an index, an articles, and a link to my gitHub (<a href="https://github.com/fathergoose">and another</a>). Wait, I need a link to github on each nav-bar. Awe, crap.</p>
                <p>Okay, took care of that. Now lets add links to each page on each nav-bar. Really? I really should have done this in a different order. </p>
                <h3>It's okay, you're doing this for the experience</h3>
                <p>Yeah, but this stinks. I'll just write a rails app to run my blog. Oh wow, I know less about rails than I thought. Well, I better have a blog so I can document everything... And we are back to square one.</p>
                <h3>Just use wordpress</h3>
                <p>No, I want all of the control all of the time... Better start coding</p>
