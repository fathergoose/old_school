 Is something I have contemplated a lot in the past months. I asked to get a chemistry set for Christmas, declared chemistry as my major as soon as possible, and spent the last four years doing product development for a chemical start-up. My affection for chemistry begain to wain, however, as I moved from the study of chemisty into the practice of chemistry. I have come to realize that the reason for this disconnect has to do with the difference between science and engeneering or, per the title of this post, the difference between computers and chemistry.

It's insturctive to look at the verbs we associate with working in a lab or with a computers. We write code to develop software, very few people (if any) would say they research code. However, any chemist wishing to build something new does not have the luxury of 'writing' reactions, and checking them with the push of a button. Insted, experiments are proposed and executed. Most of these experiments are mearly gathering a list of things that will not work untill the researcher is out of time, money, or ideas. In this respect, the process looks a bit like mining for gold. A lot more dirt gets dug up than gold.
