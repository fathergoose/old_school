                <h1>the difference between chemistry and computers</h1>
                <p>Is something I have contemplated a lot in the past months. As a child, I asked to get a chemistry set for Christmas, declared chemistry  my major as soon as possible, and spent the last four years doing product development for a chemical start-up. Moving from the study of chemistry to the practice of chemistry, my affection began to wain. I started reading up on electronics and eventually, a little computer science. My interest in electronics and computers grew to be greater than my initial intrest in chemistry. This made me begin to wonder what was different about computers that kept me coming back for more and more information every chance I got. The difference was people. </p>
                <p>People write software and the gods write chemistry. Chemistry is always a bit of hack and predicting the behavior of chemicals is like predicting the weather. There are trends, models, but the system under study is too complex to be completely understood. This is the case with chemistry, where theory always has to answer to experimentation.</p>
                <p>Experimentation is no walk in the park. A hypothesis can get you into the lab, but only a great deal of failures will ever lead you out. I compare the process of scientific discovery to mining gold. When mining gold, most of the effort is spent digging dirt. This process is not for the feint of heart or those less gifted in the art of long suffering. </p>
                <p>Software isn’t discovered, it is built, engineered, developed, and written. Studying computers and software is the study of systems designed by humans. These human authors present their own sets of challenges, but challenges in which I am excited to engage. The ability to study the designs of others is something that compels me. There's something less exciting about the the universe always being there aside from our understanding it. If everyone wakes up tomorrow having forgotten everything they ever knew about electronics, the lights would eventually go out and all the computers would be repurposed as door-stops. Chemistry wouldn’t ever know the difference it would keep on its merry way without us. Thats okay—I never loved you anyway, Chemistry.</p>
